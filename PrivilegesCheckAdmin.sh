# This script is designed to be run in conjunction with a Privileges LaunchDaemon to demote 
# a specific user from using the Privileges.app to promote themselves
# - Queries a User attribute set as an extension attribute
# - Sets a timer (20 minutes)
# - Logs the actions taken by a user (to be used by future syslog server)
# - Removes the User from the admin group via the Privileges CLI
